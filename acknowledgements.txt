NServiceBus uses multiple existing open source projects that have been invaluable resources and made creating NServiceBus possible.

The NServiceBus team gives its thanks to:

Spring Framework .NET (http://springframework.net/)
The Castle Project (http://castleproject.org/)
Rhino Mocks (http://groups.google.com/group/RhinoMocks/)
